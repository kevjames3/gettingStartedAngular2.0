This repository is a continuation of https://github.com/angular/quickstart.git, but with everything updated, plus with gulp and sourcemaps.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run 

```
npm start
```

After that, I would go to [here and start learning](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt1#keep-the-app-transpiling-and-running) :D
